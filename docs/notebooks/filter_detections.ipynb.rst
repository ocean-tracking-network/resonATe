# Filtering Detections on Distance / Time
-----------------------------------------

-  Use the variables below to point the Toolbox scripts at your data.
-  Fill in the strings that are commented with **# REQUIRED:** then
   highlight a cell and hit Run Cell ('play' button above)

.. code:: ipython2

    #  Set some variables
    detection_file = ''      #  REQUIRED: And provide the filename here
    
    time_interval = 60 #  OPTIONAL: Time interval used to evaluate suspect detections (in minutes)
    
    # If you have your own file of suspect detections, point to it here 
    SuspectFile = None # Include file path to suspect file or leave blank to have the suspect detections generated by the filter step
    
    #  If you'd like to create a customizable distance matrix file for adjusting the distance 
    #  between stations found in the above detection file
    CreateDistanceMatrix = True #  True / False

.. code:: ipython2

    #%cd /home/user/data/ # uncomment to change the working directory
    from otntoolbox.filter_detections import get_distance_matrix
    from otntoolbox.filter_detections import filter_detections
    
    
    filtered_detections = filter_detections(detection_file, suspect_file=SuspectFile, 
                                           min_time_buffer=time_interval,
                                           distance_matrix=CreateDistanceMatrix)
    
    filtered_detections # preview output
